# Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog?



Inspired by a joke on the show "Silicon Valley" where a software engineer demonstrates a classifier, 
which ends up being a binary one that can only detect whether an object is a hot dog, or if it is not a hot dog (that is, everything else).

Working with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python, a convolutional neural network classifier was built. 
It was then trained using a database of over 4000 images in order to achieve a high degree of accuracy.

Any square image could be uploaded to a simple HTML website that would then classify the image and return the result: hot dog? or not hot dog?
